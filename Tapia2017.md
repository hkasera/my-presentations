# Online education through Massive Open Online Courses

## Abstract
Ever wanted to create an Android application, get started in Machine Learning, or utilize social media marketing but don’t know where to start? With massive open online courses (MOOCs), the task has become easier than ever before. 

We often experience the lack of hands-on projects to supplement university-level courses. However, it is no secret that many tech companies value “real-world” skills. The purpose of our talk is to bring attention to affordable online resources, bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical knowledge.

We will share our favorite online courses, discuss ways to navigate MOOC providers, and tips to stay motivated throughout the self-paced learning process. We will also address the challenges that we faced while pursuing these courses, and offer some interesting ideas that we used. By the end of the session, attendees will leave with a list of MOOC resources, and confidence in self-paced online learning.
