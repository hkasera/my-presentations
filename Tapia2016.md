# Open Source Contributions -The Earlier the Better!

### Abstract

Open Source Development is often associated with programming and coding. 
However, this is not true. Anyone can share any information which can help others. 
One can open source anything. It could be a list of resources helpful for on boarding to a specific class or even a book. 
The basic idea of open source is sharing something to the whole world.

Now, it is very important for students to understand and get on board as early as possible. 
The reason being almost all the companies encourage such a culture. 
It is very overwhelming at once, but one step at a time can help you get through. 
Universities can help students by encouraging the same behavior. 
The university projects could be open sourced or even pair projects can be helpful to understand collaborations.

The basic idea here is to encourage open source contribution as a culture from the very beginning.
