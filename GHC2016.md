#### Solving Waste Management Issues with Smart Dustbins
In this talk, we present a prototype version of an application that demonstrates how the Internet of Things can solve waste management problems in the society. The idea being floated is to use Internet of Things (IoT) â€” an integration of small devices linked by a web-based system which can send signals through sensors and interact with an online system.
